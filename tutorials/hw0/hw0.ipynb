    "Welcome to python for astronomers! This semester, we are trying something a little bit new when it comes to grading code. If anyone has taken a CS class like 61a, or DS8, you'll be familiar with the turn in system okpy (invented by the cs department). If you haven't, don't worry! From the user perspective, it's super easy to use. However, do please bear with us a tiny bit as there might be a bug or two on our side of the implementation as the semester starts. \n",
