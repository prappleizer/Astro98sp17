    "Above we have a fully functional, recursive factorial function. Note that the word recursive used as a variable name is not \"special\", we could've use any variable names for anything in the function. Notice how if you plug in an n greater than 0, it calls itself on one below your n, and if THAT is greater than 0, it does it again, and again, until finally, n-1 is 0. Then when it plugs in n=0, it finally returns one. But all of this is in the control flow of the function, so each time it re calls itself, it multiplies n by the output of the function itself called on n-1, in result. This is really mind-boggling, but think about it slowly for a while. Check it yourself to see that it works. Once you're ready, you can try it yourself!"
