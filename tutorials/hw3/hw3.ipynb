    "In lecture Tuesday we learned that combinations of conditionals and loops could make our code much more powerful. In last week’s tutorial, you loaded up a spectrum, performed some basic array manipulation and slicing on it, and viewed it. Today we are going to continue with spectral analysis, this time performing a step known as ”centroiding”. The code you will need to write to load up, correct, and centroid a spectrum will require you to use both loops and conditionals.\n"

    "If we take a look at a typical a neon emission spectrum, (or any gas for that matter) we would see sharp emission peaks at very distinct wavelengths. This occurs because when atoms are energized (in the case of a neon lamp, by an electric current, and in the case of gas in space, by high energy photons coming from elsewhere) they release photons, but they can only do so at several quantized energies (wavelengths). Think of the Bohr model of the atom. An energized electron can drop from the 4th to the 2nd energy level, or the 3rd to 2nd, or the 2nd to 1st, etc. Because those energy levels are quantized, the energies of the photons emitted when an electron falls n levels is also quantized. Every atom has a specific arrangement of electron orbitals that makes it such that the combination of wavelengths it can output due to electron cascading is unique (so a trained spectroscopist can look at almost any emission spectrum and recognize the element!). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we view spectra like the one we will plot below, we notice that the sharp peaks do in fact have a certain width, despite the description above indicating they should be perfect vertical lines at some defined wavelengths. There are numerous reasons for the widening: spectrometers introduce some widening (instrumental effects- better spectrometers have smaller widths), fast moving gas has doppler shifts associated with some photons, and, at a theoretical level, we know from quantum physics that there is always imprecision in either the electron's position or momentum (though this would be a tiny effect in this situation). \n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, if we are to perform any sort of scientific analysis on a spectrum, we need to know for each of those peaks what our best guess for the single \"right\" wavelength for that line should be. One typical method of determining this is centroiding.\n",

    "**What we will learn** In addition to the basics of actually centroiding a spectrum, this tutorial is meant as an introduction to loops and conditionals, the building blocks of most python code. \n"

We would of course rather like to know what **wavelengths** these emission lines correspond to. Thus, we need to know the pixel to wavelength ratio of our spectrometer. By recognizing certain lines (a skill invaluable to spectroscopists and that often involves squinting at other spectra looking for similarities in pattern), we can map our 20 ish calculated centroids to 20 ish known wavelengths for those lines (from a database like NIST), and through a fitting proccess determine the formula to then turn any pixel in our ccd into a wavelength.
