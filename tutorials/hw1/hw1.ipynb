    "As a last note, we are going to introduce a datatype we didn't go over before. This datatype is known as a <b>dictionary</b>. It's useful at times, but for the most part, you won't be using them. In the tutorial above, you saw that you could get the ith \"thing\" in a list (or array or string) by a proccess known as \"indexing\"- that was the num_list[3] thing. Accessing data in a dictionary is a little bit different. Instead of having to know exactly which entry your value is stored in the disctionary, you attach what's known as a <b>key</b> to it. Dictionaries are composed of keys paired with values, and you can \"index\" your dictionary (with the same [] notation) using the keys. Here's an example:"
